**StreamLight** is the client half of the FoggyBytes streaming duo: a fork of [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) with a gamepad-first interface and native integration with its host-side companion, [**StreamTweak**](https://github.com/FoggyBytes/StreamTweak).

The streaming engine is untouched from upstream Moonlight — FFmpeg, D3D11VA, DXVA2, libplacebo, `moonlight-common-c`. What is new sits around it: the interface, and everything the two apps can do together over a local TCP bridge — host link matching, host metrics in the overlay, the store each game comes from, session quality reports, remote power-off and Windows Update, Tailscale, and signing a woken host in with its PIN from the sofa.

## ✅ Compatibility

Windows 10 and 11. Works as an ordinary Moonlight-compatible client against any **Sunshine / Apollo / Vibeshine / Vibepollo** host, and unlocks its paired feature set when [**StreamTweak**](https://github.com/FoggyBytes/StreamTweak) is running on the host.

> 🔐 **The bridge is authenticated.** Every command StreamLight sends is signed with its existing Moonlight identity certificate; the host approves each client once, via a 4-digit PIN shown on both screens. **Streaming never depends on it** — without approval you stream normally and simply lose the paired features. Each host card shows its state as a badge (AUTHORIZED / PENDING / DENIED).

> ⚠️ **Not affiliated with or endorsed by the Moonlight project.** StreamLight is an independent fork. For upstream Moonlight support, use the [official client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt).

## 🔥 Features

Everything below is in the current release, whichever version first introduced it.

**🕹️ Gamepad-first, keyboard-equal**
- Every action is reachable from the pad: D-pad across host tabs, library, settings tabs and dialogs, with a clickable prompt bar along the bottom
- **Prompts follow the device in your hands** — touch the keyboard and each glyph becomes the key to press; pick the pad back up and they return to that controller's own icons (Xbox / PlayStation / Nintendo, auto-detected or forced)
- **Rebindable shortcuts** — every in-stream keyboard hotkey and all three controller combos, in *Settings → Shortcuts*. Defaults are **LB + RB + A** quit, **+ X** performance overlay, **+ B** stream settings, chosen to stay clear of Steam's overlay

**🏠 Home and the host page**
- **Home** is your hosts as tabs under the wordmark, the selected one filling the screen: name, state, addresses, stream settings and actions at once. **LT / RT** move between hosts, **LB / RB** between that host's profiles
- **The host page** puts the library down the left at full height and the game in the spotlight beside it — cover, name, store, and the right verb (*Resume* if it is already running, *Play* if not)
- **Per-host backgrounds** — a colour you pick or a picture of your own, with the card's gradient derived from it
- **Your accent colour** — five presets or any hex code. Status colours never follow it: online stays green, a pending link change amber, *Shutdown* red
- **Time, date and battery** in the top right of every screen, in the clock and date format you read

**🎬 In-stream**
- **Performance overlay, built line by line** — eleven lines to choose from, switched on and off *on the overlay itself* in Settings, plus corner, text colour, font size and transparency. Minimal / Default / Full remain as starting points
- **Stream Settings panel** — change resolution, frame rate, bitrate, HDR and frame pacing **while streaming**, applied with a brief reconnect and host-agnostic. It takes the corner the performance overlay is not using
- **Custom resolutions** — any width and height, not just the presets, from Settings or the in-stream panel
- **Frame pacing** — Off or On, evening frames out with the same software pacer Moonlight uses

**⚙️ Settings and profiles**
- Ten tabs, pill-style selectors instead of dropdowns, inline subtitles instead of tooltips, and a bitrate slider with hold-to-accelerate and a **Default** prompt
- **Per-host profiles** — up to three named profiles per host, each overriding resolution, frame rate, bitrate, HDR, codec, display mode, V-Sync, frame pacing, audio, link matching, launch wait and Hue. Switchable from Home or the host page
- **Per-game overrides** on top of the active profile, for the settings that vary by title
- A setting that cannot act says so wherever you meet it — greyed, with the reason on the line beneath, in Settings, in the profile and in the per-game dialog alike
- Every change is written to disk the moment you make it

**🎯 Windows Xbox app integration**
- Branded tile artwork in the Windows 11 Xbox app's "My apps" section, seeded during setup and re-applied automatically whenever the Xbox app overwrites it

**💡 Philips Hue Sync**
- Optional: starts Hue Sync on this PC when a session begins and closes it when it ends, silently, with the install path resolved from the registry

## 🔗 Paired Features (with StreamTweak)

These cross the bridge and need both apps. The version shown is the **minimum StreamTweak** on the host.

All of them are switched on **per host**, in **Settings → StreamTweak** — a host added from StreamLight 5.2.0 on starts off, and hosts you were already using StreamTweak with are switched on for you on first run. Streaming itself is never affected either way.

- **Host link matching** *(8.1.0+)* — before each launch StreamLight measures the wired link that actually reaches that host, asks the host to come down to it, and starts the stream only once the host confirms. A host running faster than the client sends each frame as a burst the slower link cannot drain, and the packets that die first are the few carrying audio: the symptom is sound cutting out while the picture stays perfect. The client decides the speed because only the client knows its own connection; the host keeps the permission and the restore
- **Seamless launch** *(8.1.0+, opt-in)* — with **Wait for the game to appear** on, the stream window stays hidden until the host reports the game is really on screen, so you watch the game's cover art instead of the host's desktop rearranging itself. **B** or **Esc** reveals the host at any moment
- **Remote PIN unlock** *(8.1.0+)* — after a **Wake**, if the host comes up at its lock screen, a controller-navigable number pad takes its Windows PIN. The session carrying the PIN is never shown and never recorded on the host; wrong attempts stop at three, since Windows suspends the PIN after a few failures
- **Host session report** *(8.1.0+)* — the host's last finished session on its card: grade, age, duration, RTT and peak, host frame latency, drop rate, and the covers of what was played
- **Host metrics in the overlay** *(4.4.0+)* — GPU %, encoder %, GPU temperature, VRAM, CPU and network TX, hidden entirely when StreamTweak is unreachable
- **Store badges** *(5.0.0+)* — which store the selected game comes from, its mark beside its name on the host page: Steam, Epic, GOG, Ubisoft, Xbox, Battle.net and EA App
- **Session quality reporting** *(5.2.0+)* — FPS, drops, RTT, jitter, decode latency and bitrate sent every second; StreamTweak turns them into a grade and charts
- **Delivered vs target bitrate** *(8.0.0+)* — StreamLight reports the rate it was told to aim for, so the host can show what it actually delivered against it. Neither side can work that out alone
- **Remote host power-off** *(7.2.0+)* — a **Power…** chooser for the host, this PC, or both, on an authorized host only
- **Remote Windows Update** *(7.3.0+)* — scan, classify and install updates on the host, rebooting only if required, with a backgroundable progress view. Updates can also be installed before a shutdown
- **Remote session pause** *(6.0.0+)* — the Pause button on StreamTweak's dashboard ends the stream client-side
- **Tailscale in one tile** *(6.3.0+)* — a host reachable both on the LAN and over Tailscale stays a single tile that tracks both addresses and uses whichever is available, with an option to force the `100.x` endpoint. Pairs with the **Auto-start Tailscale** toggle, so opening StreamLight is enough to stream from anywhere

## ✨ What's New in 5.2.0 — Hands Off

StreamLight stops taking the presentation of frames into its own hands: between the decoder and your screen it now runs Moonlight's own code, with Moonlight's current protocol and video libraries alongside it. And everything that needs StreamTweak on the host moves behind one switch per host, in a Settings tab of its own.

- **A StreamTweak tab in Settings.** Everything StreamLight can do only with StreamTweak on the host, listed in one place, with a switch for each of your hosts and the download link that used to sit in About. Each row says whether StreamTweak is actually answering on that host
- **Frame pacing is Moonlight's again.** The half-rate cadence added in 3.4.0 smoothed 60 FPS on a 120 Hz screen by holding each frame for two refreshes — but holding frames that way makes them pile up in the graphics driver, and that is the drifting delay behind [issue #9](https://github.com/FoggyBytes/StreamLight/issues/9). Frames are now presented the moment they are ready, and any evening out is the same software pacer Moonlight uses
- **Frame pacing is now Off or On.** *Automatic* and *Software* both meant the same thing once there was no hardware path left, and *Hardware* meant nothing at all. Your setting carries over
- ⚠️ **Refresh rate switching has been removed**, and with it *Match frame rate*. Your screen goes to the highest refresh rate your frame rate divides into, as Moonlight does. Stated plainly: a 60 FPS stream on a 120 Hz screen can judder on camera pans again, and the fix is to halve the refresh rate at the driver level — NVIDIA Profile Inspector, or Special-K elsewhere
- **The code that talks to your host is Moonlight's current version again**, after six months behind — error correction on the processor's own instructions, malformed replies turned away rather than parsed, and Windows socket failures reported for what they are
- **The video libraries move up for the first time since March** — FFmpeg goes up a major version and the Vulkan renderer with it
- **The picture is asked for at full colour range** — all 256 levels per channel instead of the 16-235 broadcast range, which keeps detail in dark scenes. If your host answers with limited range instead, StreamLight follows what it actually sends
- **Everything in Settings answers the mouse now.** The outline under the pointer brightens, in a neutral colour so it can never be confused with the accent the pad and keyboard use, and the focus ring steps aside while you are pointing. The pointer itself gets out of the way when you pick up the controller
- **The settings that need StreamTweak grey themselves out**, naming the host, when that host has the integration switched off — and *Wait for the game to appear* now states the dependency it always had
- **The performance overlay has no Frame pacing line any more**, and the *Cadence* line added in 5.1.2 is gone with the measurement behind it. Nothing else about your overlay changes
- **Fixes** — the host-page cover is no longer left stretched after a stream, the PIN pad no longer blames your PIN when the host simply stopped answering, the banded stripes across host cards are gone, a stream that ends with no picture points at the host's graphics drivers rather than your own firewall, and StreamLight stops knocking on the StreamTweak port on hosts that do not run it

## 🏗️ Architecture

A Qt 6 / QML fork of Moonlight-Qt. The decoder pipeline — FFmpeg, D3D11VA, DXVA2, libplacebo — and the protocol, `moonlight-common-c`, are upstream's, and they track Moonlight's **development branch** rather than its releases: upstream has not tagged one since v6.1.0 in September 2024, while its master branch is still moving. As of 5.2.0 our copy of `moonlight-common-c` is identical to master's. The UI layer is ours.

Integration with StreamTweak runs over a TCP bridge on **port 47998** (LAN, line-delimited ASCII), carrying link speed (`NETINFO`, `SETSPEED`), host metrics (`STATS`), store data (`APPSTORES`), telemetry (`SESSIONDATA`), Tailscale presence, launch state (`GAMESTATE`), lock state, and the power and Windows Update commands. Each command is preceded by an `AUTH1` line signing it with the client's Moonlight certificate (RSA-SHA256); a one-time `ENROLL` registers the client with the host for approval.

```
StreamLight (Qt, client PC)
    │  TCP port 47998
    ▼
StreamTweak (WinUI 3, host PC)  →  Named Pipe  →  StreamTweakService (LocalSystem)
                                                           │
                                                           ▼
                                                NIC speed via CIM/WMI
                                                Host assets via filesystem
                                                Windows Update via WUA
```
